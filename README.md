# Deep-Residual-Network-for-Impulsive-Noise-Suppression

We would like to present our proposed CNN architecture to suppress the presence of salt-and-pepper noise.
The network architecture was built on Pytorch framework.
We use DIV2K Training Dataset with downscaling factor x3 and x4 as train set.
Each images were cut into 120x120 pixel patches.

The paper entitled "Deep-Residual Network for Impulsive Noise Suppression" had been published on October 2020
